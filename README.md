# Refactor with Sass

Let's refactor this footer element to use Sass.

- use Sass
- use variables
- use nesting
- split into appropriate partials

The final appearance of the page should not change.

## What is refactoring? 

> Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.

> Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring. Since each refactoring is small, it's less likely to go wrong. The system is kept fully working after each refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the restructuring.
